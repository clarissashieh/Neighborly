**THE PROBLEM**

Have you been worried about your out-of-state parents or grandparents because they couldn’t get to the grocery store due to the pandemic or other health reasons? Have you had sleepless nights as you wonder how they may get help? This is a familiar scenario to many. During the COVID-19 pandemic, while some have had greater flexibility in going out and completing necessary tasks, immunocompromised and elderly citizens have been required to remain in the confines of their homes. This means that they struggle to complete their own daily tasks. These tasks may include going grocery shopping, pharmacy pick-ups, dry-cleaning, etc. Some are also in need of tech support for both appointment scheduling and/or simply communicating with family members. 

Or, have you ever wanted to help your elderly neighbors but wondered who needs help and how to get in touch? This is another common question people have been wondering. Many neighbors are interested in helping but are unsure how to, as there is no place where individuals can find the answer to that question.

**OUR PRODUCT**

Our app connects neighbors. It matches volunteers with those who are in need of help. As defined in the Oxford Dictionary, “neighborly” means having the “characteristic of a good neighbor, especially helpful, friendly, or kind.” This definition is the basis for our app. It connects people locally and relies on people’s kindness to help others.

**DESCRIPTION**

Neighborly connects individuals in need of help to others who are willing to provide help. The app is designed with the goal of simplicity in order for those less comfortable with technology to still be able to use it. After a couple of taps or a simple sign-up process, users will be connected and ready to go.

The landing page consists of a login option, sign-up option, and help button. To begin using the app, the user signs up with his/her information. Depending on whether they are signing up as someone in need of help, or a volunteer, different information must be provided.

When the “I want to help” option is selected, this means that the user wants to volunteer. A sign-up page is displayed, requiring an input of email, phone number, name, zip code, the distance they are willing to travel, which is selected with a drop-down menu, and an option to select the errands that they are willing to assist with.

</p>

If “need help” is selected, the user is asked to provide their email, phone number, name, zip-code, the distance they would like their helper to be, and the tasks they need assistance with. Additionally, during the sign-up process of someone who needs help, there is a voice-to-text feature, along with other audio features. This elderly-friendly feature eliminates the need to type on a small keyboard.

Once the “need help” sign-up is complete, the elder can use the built-in search engine to find a nearby volunteer that can help with their individual needs. All of this data is saved on an external database (Firebase). Only elders can seek out caregivers as a security feature for scam/fraud prevention. Once a volunteer is selected, the elder and caregiver will be in contact with one another in order to organize their logistics.
